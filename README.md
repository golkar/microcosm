# Microcosm
A toy generative model for physics observation.

## Installation

Microcosm relies on the chaospy package to generate samples from low dimensional chaotic systems such as the Lorenz attractor. To use, clone the chaospy repo (https://github.com/hukenovs/chaospy) in the same parent folder as this microcosm repo.

## Usage
See the demo.ipynb notebook.
